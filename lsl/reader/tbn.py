"""
Python module for reading data in from TBN files.This module defines the 
following classes for storing the TBN data found in a file:

Frame
  object that contains all data associated with a particular TBN frame.  
  The primary constituents of each frame are:
    * FrameHeader - the TBN frame header object and
    * FrameData   - the TBN frame data object.
Combined, these two objects contain all of the information found in the 
original TBN frame.

ObservingBlock
object that stores a collection of Frames for all stands/polarizations for 
a particular time.

In addition to storing the data available in the frame, the Frame object also
has attributes for holding information about the gain, central frequency, and
filter code used for the observations.

The functions defined in this module fall into two class:
  1. convert a frame in a file to a Frame object and
  2. describe the format of the data in the file.

For reading in data, use the read_frame function.  It takes a python file-
handle as an input and returns a fully-filled Frame object.  The readBlock
function reads in a (user-defined) number of TBN frames and returns a 
ObservingBlock object.

For describing the format of data in the file, two function are provided:

get_sample_rate
  read in the few frame of an open file handle and return the sampling rate 
  of the data

get_frames_per_obs
  read in the first several frames to see how many stands are found in the data.

..versionchanged:: 1.2.0
    Dropped support for ObservingBlock since the lsl.reader.buffer modules does
    a better job.

.. versionchanged:: 0.4.0
    Switched over from pure Python readers to the new C-base Go Fast! readers.

.. versionchanged:: 0.5.0
    Support for ECR 11 TBN header format change.
